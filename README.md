# vsftpd Anonymous Upload Docker Image

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/ome/vsftpd-anonymous-upload-docker/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ome/vsftpd-anonymous-upload-docker/actions)

[vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html) is a GPL licensed FTP server for UNIX systems, including Linux.

This Docker image is configured to allow anonymous uploads only.

A very minimal level of access control is provided by listing allowed emails in `/etc/vsftpd.email_passwords`. `/var/lib/ftp/incoming` should be mounted as a volume, note permissions are important! xferlogs are sent to stdout.

Passive FTP ports are configured to fit with the default Kubernetes NodePort range since FTP does not support port-forwarding between different ports.

```bash
docker run -d --name vsftpd -p 21:21 -p 32022-32041:32022-32041 -v /var/lib/ftp/incoming vsftpd-anonymous-upload
```
